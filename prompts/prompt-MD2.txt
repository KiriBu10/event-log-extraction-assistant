Each record in each table represents at least one event.
If a table contains multiple timestamp attributes, then each of these attributes is related to an event.
Use the name of the column as the default value of the activity_id.

Use CaseID as the case notion.
When a table does not have an attribute that contains the selected case notion, combine the necessary tables to obtain this case notion.

Do not use the AutoDrive_Event_500_20201215_Sample table.

Use for all timestamps the most detailed timeformat that occurs in the tables.
If a value in the table is empty or NULL leave out the whole record.
Provide only the SQL query, no other comments should be part of the response.
