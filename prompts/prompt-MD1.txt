Each record in each table represents at least one event.
If a table contains multiple timestamp attributes, then each of these attributes is related to an event with the activity_id equal to the attribute name.

Use the id of the order as the case notion.

When a table does not have an attribute that contains the selected case notion, combine the necessary tables to obtain this case notion.
